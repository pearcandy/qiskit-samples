## Sample codes using qiskit for my study

- getting started with Qiskit (transpile, VQE)
- ssvqe of H2 molecule 
- vqd of H2 molecule
- Meyer-Wallach measure (check entangling capability of PQC)
- KL-divergence between the empirically-observed probability distribution and a Haar distribution (Expressibility of PQC)
- CHSH inequality / CHSH game
- Quantum Walk (in progeress)
- Quantum Euclidean Distance
- IQPE : Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation
- Quantum Autoencoder (in progress)
- Swap Test
